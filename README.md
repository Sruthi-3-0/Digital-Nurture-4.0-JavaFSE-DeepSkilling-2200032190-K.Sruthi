#  Design Patterns Hands-on Practice

This repository contains my hands-on implementation of key **Object-Oriented Design Patterns** as part of my learning and preparation of DeepSkilling.

---

##  Covered Design Patterns

1. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Implemented a `Logger` class that follows the Singleton design.
   - Demonstrated how to ensure only one instance is created and shared.

2. **Factory Method Pattern**
   - Developed a `DocumentFactory` system to create different document types (`Word`, `PDF`, `Excel`).
   - Used interface-based design and separate factory classes for each document type.

##  Document with Screenshots

A detailed Word document (converted to PDF) is included, showing:

- Class designs
- Screenshot proofs from Eclipse

# E-commerce Platform Search Function

This project implements and compares **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** on product data in an e-commerce platform. It is designed to show how algorithm efficiency affects search performance.

---

##  Features

- Product search by name
- Linear search over unsorted array
- Binary search over sorted array
- Time comparison between both searches

# Financial Forecasting Tool

This project demonstrates a simple financial forecasting tool using a **recursive algorithm** to predict future values based on past growth.

---

##  Features
- Recursive calculation of future financial value.
- alternate for the recursive function (best way).

**See:** [`Algorithms_Data Structure`](./Engineering Concepts-Handson.pdf)
