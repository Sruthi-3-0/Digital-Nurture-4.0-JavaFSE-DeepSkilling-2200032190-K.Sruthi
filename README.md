#  Design Patterns Hands-on Practice

This repository contains my hands-on implementation of key **Object-Oriented Design Patterns** as part of my learning and preparation of DeepSkilling.

---

##  Covered Design Patterns

1. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Implemented a `Logger` class that follows the Singleton design.
   - Demonstrated how to ensure only one instance is created and shared.

2. **Factory Method Pattern**
   - Developed a `DocumentFactory` system to create different document types (`Word`, `PDF`, `Excel`).
   - Used interface-based design and separate factory classes for each document type.

- Class designs
- Screenshot proofs from Eclipse
